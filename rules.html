    <h1 class ="black font">General routine of Lion Dance</h1>
     <p class ="black fontp">
    
   Celebration such as the Chinese new year, lion dance troops goes from door to
door to beg for red packets and bring good luck, long life and prosperity to the
store, owner and staff. Before the troop go out into the streets, they will have a simple ceremony to pay tribute
to the god Guan Gong. The general routine consist of the bow, eating the lettuce or mandarin, circulates
the store, bow to the owner, and bow at the end again. Some martial arts style, 
such as the head standing on tail is also performed. Drum, gong and cymbals will be play to support the lions. 
If only one lion is performing, the drum follows the lion, but if there is more than one lion, the lions follows the lead of the drum.

    <h1 class ="black font">Rules of lion dancing</h1>
     <p class ="black fontp">

Before a new lion is being used there will be a ceremony, called “點睛(dimjeng)”
which literally means dotting the eyeball. They will use the paint cinnabar 硃砂 to paint
on its eyes and the top of its head. It is to give the lion life and spirituality.</p>  

<p class ="black fontp">There are many rules in lion dancing.The following are some of the most followed rules:</p>



<ul class="black">
<li>If the lion see the god statues, it must bow to the god statues.</li>
<li>The gong and the cymbals must not be played unless the drum is playing.</li>
<li>When passing cemeteries, all music stops and if you need to perform for a
store between cemeteries, only the drums play.</li>
<li>If you see another lion in the streets, you must stay your head low and bow to
each other. Raising your head in that occasion means that you want to fight. In
the 60s lion dance groups actually literally fight each other, I am lucky that I
am not performing lion dance at that time.</li>
<li>When you do the bow before entering the store, make sure the door is open
before you do the bow.</li>
<li>When you need to go into a store. Always goes head in, and tail out.</li>
<li>Not following these rules may result in being kicked out of the store or even
more serious problems.  </li>
 </ul>
