      <h1 class="black font">What is Lion Dance</h1>
    <p class="black fontp">Lion dance is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture and other Asian countries in 

which performers 
mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume. The lion dance is usually performed during the Chinese 

New Year 
and other Chinese traditional, cultural and religious festivals. It may also be performed at 

important occasions 
such as business opening events, special celebrations or wedding ceremonies, or may be used to 

honour 
special guests by the Chinese communities.</p>
<p class="black fontp">The Chinese lion dance is often mistakenly referred to as dragon dance. An easy way to tell the 

difference 
is that a lion is normally operated by two dancers, while a dragon needs many people. Also, in a 

lion dance,
the performers' faces are only seen occasionally, since they are inside the lion. In a dragon 

dance, the 
performers' faces can be easily seen since the dragon is held on poles. Chinese lion dance 

fundamental 
movements can be found in most Chinese martial arts.</p>
